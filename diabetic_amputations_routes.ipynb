    "### (1) Find Isochrones for Grocery Stores vs. Dollar Stores\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Eau Claire community in Columbia, SC, we are interested in the proximity of residents to dollar stores vs proximity to grocery stores. Using the USDA's Low-Income, Low-Access definition, we are minimally interested in the distances at 1/2 mile and 1 mile. For low-income residents with low access to transportation, it's critical to be within 1/2 mile or at least 1 mile of a grocery store.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help find these distances, we started with a dataset of buildings in the Columbia, SC area derived from [Microsoft's Building Footprint Data](https://github.com/Microsoft/USBuildingFootprints). We used the Mapshaper GUI to take the full dataset, clip it by a Columbia, SC shapefile, and output only the Columbia, SC buildings. The downside of the data is that it does not indicate which buildings are residential, so ultimately, the maps are more of a proxy than an exact representation of residential distance to stores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we're clipping the building data further to only include the greater Eau Claire area. After clipping, we then use an isochrone API from [Openrouteservice](https://openrouteservice.org/dev/#/api-docs/v2/isochrones) to create isochrone polygons (a polygon whose bounds are X miles away from a specified point) for all dollar stores and grocery stores. We then clip the building data by isochrones at 1/4 mile, 1/2 mile, 3/4 mile, and 1 mile distances away from the specific point. We output that data, reaggregate it and label each building by which isochrone zone it is in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately each building will be tagged with a label indicating which isochrone it was grouped into. For instance, the isochrone tags for how far a building is from a grocery store would be the following. The value after the dash indicates the number of meters away from the grocery store since Openrouteservice uses meters. \n",
