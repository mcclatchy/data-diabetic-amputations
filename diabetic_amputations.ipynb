    "The State Media Co. filed open records requests to gain hospital discharge data from southeastern states from 2016 to 2020. The data consisted of 76 procedural codes for nontraumatic lower extremity amputations for diabetic patients, broken down by each patient’s ZIP code of residence. Four southeastern states (Louisiana, Arkansas, North Carolina and Tennessee) either did not have data or would not provide it. ZIP code populations, according to 5-year averages from the U.S. Census Bureau, were then divided by the number of amputations for each ZIP code for each year to create a rate. For privacy reasons, some states suppressed amputation data for certain ZIP codes when there were fewer than five procedures. The newspaper then took the population size of 29203 and compared it with ZIP codes the same size or larger in South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi."

    "### (9) Calculating Averages and Rankings\n",
    "\n",
    "This output looks at ZIP codes above 39000 people across Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina from 2016-2020. The purpose is to find rankings and average amputation rates across these years.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Methodology\n",
    "The authors' chosen methodology was to compare population-wide diabetic amputation rates for ZIP codes **the same size or larger** than the point of reference of 29203 (whose 5-year average population is ~39.9K). However, there are many other options for methods of comparison. \n",
    "\n",
    "From a data similarity perspective, it is likely more appropriate to compare 29203 to a range of populations, both above and below its own population of 39K: for instance a range between 20K and 60K. If we followed this methodology, 29203's amputation rate would have the 11th-worst amputation rate instead of 1st-worst over the 5-year span (when including MS, AL, GA and SC). \n",
    "\n",
    "If we also add the states of Kentucky, West Virginia and Virginia (whose data was also collected by The State Media Co. - Florida was also collected, though there's a chance the methodology may count individual amputation procedures rather than number of individuals who received amputations) into this methodology, 29203 would rank 34th-worst. Separately, it may make sense to compare ZIP codes with similar population densities amongst ZIP codes instead. \n",
    "\n",
    "From a data metric perspective, a population-wide diabetic amputation rate is not the best metric for care specific to people with diabetes. If 100% of the population of a 10,000 person town had diabetes, and 10 people recieved amputations, the population-wide amputation rate would be **10 per 10K residents**. The diabetic-population amputation rate would be **10 per 10K diabetics**, since everyone has diabetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if 10% of the population of 10,000 person town had diabetes (i.e. 1000 people), and 10 people still received amputations, the population-wide amputation rate would still be **10 per 10K residents**. However, the diabetic-population amputation rate would now be **100 per 10K diabetics%** (5/10). The second group of diabetics are receiving significantly worse care, with much worse outcomes. This metric would better encapsulate a comparison of diabetic amputations across ZIP codes as well. "
